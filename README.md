# PokePlayer

PokePlayer is a WPF application that brings back the oldschool vibes of Pokemon on the Nintendo DS.
With the use of the PokeApi and Bulbapedia I've created an application where you can battle Pokemons like the good old times.
You cannot only battle, you can also create a trainer, catch pokemons and switch Pokemons from the party.
